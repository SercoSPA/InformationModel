	<p>The Information Model defines a high-level and domain-agnostic vocabulary of the Copernicus Data Space that constitutes a central agreement shared by its participants and components.</p>
	<p>The Information Model ensures:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>compatibility and interoperability, as its structured, semantic annotation ensures the provision of the most relevant assets to TPUs willing to integrate their service components</li>
		<li>an automated consumption of offerings via service interface, with known protocol and agreed governance</li>
		<li>free and open access to the definition of all the classes and properties of the Copernicus Data Spaces entities, its participants, infrastructure components and processes, on a documental level</li>
	</ul>

		</center>
		<p>Following the WC3 OWL reference standard, the semantics of an information model is implemented by the following logical entities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Individuals (classes or sub-classes), providing an abstraction mechanism for grouping elements with similar characteristics</li>
			<li>Properties, which extend individuals characteristics, and in particular :</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Object properties, linking individuals to other individuals</li>
				<li>Data properties, linking individuals to data values</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>In Figure 1 we display the relationships between such semantic entities.</p>

		</center>
		<p> 
			In the following Sections, we detail our proposed information model applicable to the Copernicus Data Space ecosystem.<br><br>

			The reported information model contents are relevant to a general Service - including main classes, object and data properties, 
			with descriptions and required formats.<br><br>
			
			Since the CDS ecosystem is a set of Services, this information model is applicable to the CDS, encompassing all 
			the entities of the Copernicus Data Space ecosystem – 
			end services, intermediate services and policy framework (refer to [AD-3]). This will be depicted in Section 4.<br><br>
		</p>
		<h2 style="color:#004d99">3.1 Facets</h2> 
		<p>Following the approach of [RD-1], the overall view can be divided into logical groups of concepts (hereinafter called facets), 
		addressing different static and dynamic aspects of the Copernicus Data Space. Most of the facets are named after the key concept they represent. </p>
		<br><br>
		<h3 style="color:#004d99">3.1.1	Copernicus Data Space Facets</h3> 
		<p>Facets of CDS Eco-System and their interactions are shown in Figure 4 and described hereafter.</p>

			<br>
		</center>
		<br><br>
		<h3 style="color:#004d99">3.1.1.1	Participant</h3> 
		<p>
			A <b>Participant</b> is a legal or natural person assuming a role (or more than one role) in the CDS. For certain, critical roles to assume,
			participants must undergo a certification. Certification of participants is considered a measure to establish trust across the
			Copernicus Data Space. A Participant can be an organization (or organizational unit) or an individual. If the participant is an individual 
			(<b>Person</b>), he or she may assume a specific role in the corresponding organization. The participant concept may indicate the type of business
			and the domain in which operates.
		<br><br>
			Each Participant can be assigned to one or more unambiguously defined sites. Site information comprises the name and address of the site as well
			as geo-location information. It is particularly important in cases in which specific rules (e.g., national law) apply, affecting, for example, 
			the data usage control policy.
		<br><br>
			Each Action (Section 3.1.1.4) that a Participant can perform thanks to a Data Service (Section 3.1.1.2) could have an associated price relevant 
			to the involved Resource (Section 3.1.1.2).

			<br>
		</center>
		<br><br>
		<h3 style="color:#004d99">3.1.1.2	Resource</h3> 
		<p>
			A <b>Resource</b> is an identifiable, valuable, digital (non-physical) commodity exchanged among Participants by means of the 
			Infrastructure of the Copernicus Data Space.  They can be:
			<ul>
				<li><b>Data Assets</b>, which are resources subject to forwarding, processing, or consumption. </li>
				<li><b>Data Apps</b> which comprehend the applications installed onto Connectors (Section 3.1.1.3) to communicate or process data on behalf of CDS participants.</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			The Data App concept is largely determined by functionality and highlights a formal description of the function, deployment prerequisites. 
			Data Apps are self-contained and self-descriptive software packages extending the functionality of the generic Connector with custom 
			capabilities. In addition, there are <b>Data App Plug-ins</b> and <b>Data App Assets</b>. A Data App Plug-in is an add-on of a Data App, adding new 
			capabilities to it. The extension management process for selection, installation, and maintenance of such plugins has to be implemented 
			by the respective Data App in accordance with the security policies of the Connector. A Data App Asset is a machine-interpretable Data Asset, 
			such as a script file, algorithm, rule set, or another type of code, which execution relies on a particular runtime environment.
			<br><br>
			A Data Service represents an End-Service constituted by Data Apps, implementing relevant functions. A Data Service can integrate one or more of 
			these applications, depending on its scope, e.g. discovery, download, trace, distribute, produce, process, order, archive, etc. 
			<br><br>
			Such operations on Data Asset defines the type of a Data Service. 
			<br><br>		
			Data Services are all services users aim to use. According to End-Services definition provided in [AD-3], 
			"the access to these services is protected and the relative usage is managed by the policy framework. 
			These services shall allow consumers to access data, applications and computing and storage resources”. 
			<br><br>
			Each Data Service will expose Data App Endpoints to reach its specific Data Apps.

		<h3 style="color:#004d99">3.1.1.3	Infrastructure</h3> 
		<p>
			<b>Infrastructure</b> facet is related to description of certified components used by participants in the Copernicus Data Space to perform business 
			interactions, leading to the exchange and consumption of resources in compliance with defined regulations. It comprehends all the <b>ecosystem 
			components</b> of the Copernicus Data Space, meant as the Intermediary Services stated in [AD-3] as “all the trusted entities within the ecosystem, 
			competing in providing metadata, creating a business model around services, establishing trust among participants” [AD-3]. 
			These services are the pillars of the ecosystem set up and are unique, within the scope of ecosystem intermediary. 
		<br><br>	
			Among the ecosystem components, Identity Provider, Broker, Clearing House and Service Catalogue are present. 
			The <b>Broker</b> component is a meta-data registry of Data Asset offering. The <b>Identity Provider</b> manages and validates the digital identity of 
			Industrial Data Space Participants. The <b>Clearing House</b> provides clearing and settlement services B2B interactions within the Industrial Data
			Space. The <b>Service Catalogue</b> catalogues all applications, services, data and software available for re-use by Third-Party users. 
			The <b>Wallet</b> is in charge of managing and allowing financial transaction.
		<br><br>
			Information relevant to an Action, the Data Service that allows it and the Participant who performs it are stored as transaction data into the 
			Clearing House. The Wallet Service reads the transaction information and calculate the cost consumed by the Participant on the basis of the 
			action and its pricing strategy.
		<br><br>
			Then, the Wallet Service records the transaction and associates it to the specific participant’s wallet.	
		<br><br>
		<br><br>
			The <b>Connector</b> is the infrastructure core building block and is a communication server providing and consuming data by means of Data Apps via 
			<b>endpoints</b>. It constitutes the basis for the implementation of other, more specialized components. A Participant providing an end-service will 
			be supplied with proper number of Connectors and relevant correct properties to deploy their applications, according to 
			an agreed deployment mode. <b>Data Service</b> is the class relevant to these end-services.
		<br><br>
			The endpoints exposed by Connectors, offer digital commodities that are optionally advertised by publication at the metadata registries, 
			the Broker. Furthermore, the responsible Participant operating the Connector (Service Provider) and the deployment type (on-premises vs. cloud) 
			is referenced.

		<br><br>
		<h3 style="color:#004d99">3.1.1.4	Regulation</h3> 
		<p>
		<br><br>
			The <b>Regulation</b> facet includes also concepts underlying business interactions among the CDS Participant, i.e. 
			the interchange and consumption of Resources according to defined Regulations - supporting <i>security</i>, 
			<i>traceability</i> and <i>usage control</i> purposes. 
		<br><br>
			Important classes in this facet include Rules, Actions, Constraints and Contracts.
		<br><br>	
			The <b>Rules</b> specify <b>Actions</b> that an involved Participant is obliged, permitted or prohibited to perform with respect to Resource.
			Formal <b>Constraints</b> state the applicability of Rules and refine the interpretation of Actions. 
			An example of constraint is that all Participants with their headquarter in Europe might be a potential 
			consumer of GDPR-releated data.
		<br><br>
			An Action is associated with the Resource via the action property in a Rule.
		<br><br>
			The Rule provides the specific interpretations of the Action. For example; an Action is permitted to be exercised on the 
			target Resource when related to a Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action indicates the operation that is 
			prohibited to be exercised on the target Resource. When related to a Duty, the Action indicates the agreed operation that 
			is obligatory to be fulfilled by a Participant.
		<br><br>
			Constraints are boolean/logical expressions that can be used to refine the semantics of an Action and Participant/Resource 
			or declare the conditions applicable to a Rule. Constraints can be represented as a Constraint class or Logical Constraint class.
			A Logical Constraint will refer to existing Constraints as its operands. 
		<br><br>
			A Constraint class is used for expressions which compare two operands (which are not Constraints) by one relational operator. 
			If the comparison returns a match the Constraint is satisfied, otherwise it is not satisfied. 
			The Constraint class formulates a comparison expression. For example: the number of usages (the leftOperand) must be smaller 
			than (the operator) the number 10 (the rightOperand). 
		<br><br>
			A <b>Contract</b> express Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties related to the usage of Resource. 
			It defines a validity Period and formal Rules agreed upon by Participants involved in the provision, 
			or subsequent usage of the Resource. Contracts formalize the expectations on behavior of involved Participants i
			n a declarative, technology-agnostic way. The perpetual control and enforcement of such specification 
			level policies may involve the inception of governance processes or, when appropriate the deployment of a technological solution.
