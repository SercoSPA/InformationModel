		</center>
		<p>Following the WC3 OWL reference standard, the semantics of an information model is implemented by the following logical entities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Individuals (classes or sub-classes), providing an abstraction mechanism for grouping elements with similar characteristics</li>
			<li>Properties, providing an instance of individuals, in particular:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Object properties, linking individuals to other individuals</li>
				<li>Data properties, linking individuals to data values</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>In Figure 1 a big picture of the possible relationships between such semantic entities is given.</p>

		<p>Object properties relationships detail is given in Figure 2. In this representation, the object property may indicate the predicate verb between a subject (class or subclass) and an object (another class or subclass).</p>
		<br>
		<p>For example, given a class Collection, defined as a set of data items which show similar characteristics, <i>is composed by</i> the class called Data Item. The instance <i>is composed by</i> is an object property. Thus, Data Collection is in domain of <i>is composed by</i> while Data Item is in range of <i>is composed by</i> object property. Vice versa, the object property <i>is composed by</i> has domain Data Collection and has range Data Item.</p>

		<p>Within an information model, a <b>reasoner</b> is a SW element able to infer the logics logical consequences from a set of individuals, given the spectrum of possibilities of the diagrams above.</p>
