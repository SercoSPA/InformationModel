		</center>
		<p>Following the WC3 OWL reference standard, the semantics of an information model is implemented by the following logical entities:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Individuals (classes or sub-classes), providing an abstraction mechanism for grouping elements with similar characteristics</li>
			<li>Properties, providing an instance of individuals, in particular:</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Object properties, linking individuals to other individuals</li>
				<li>Data properties, linking individuals to data values</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<p>In Figure 1 a big picture of the possible relationships between such semantic entities is given.</p>

		</center>
		<p> 
			In the following Sections, a high-level information model applicable to the Copernicus Data Space ecosystem is described.<br><br>

			The reported information model contents are relevant to a general Service - including main classes, object and data properties, with descriptions and required formats.<br><br>
			
			Since the CDS ecosystem is a set of Services, this information model could be applicable to the CDS, encompassing all the entities of the Copernicus Data Space ecosystem – intermediate [AD-4] included. This will be depicted in Section 4.<br><br>
			
			Concerning the CDS End-Services defined in the Ecosystem TN [AD-4], the Service information model can describe them as well. In this case, it will be tailored in terms of logical entities.<br><br>
		</p>
		<h1 style="color:#004d99">Facets</h1> 
		<p>Following the approach of [RD-1], the overall view can be divided into logical groups of concepts (hereinafter called facets), addressing different static and dynamic aspects of the Copernicus Data Space. Most of the facets were named after the key concept they contain.</p>

		<br><br>

			A <b>Resource</b> is an identifiable, valuable, digital (non-physical) commodity exchanged among Participants by means of the Infrastructure
			of the Copernicus Data Space. <b>Data Assets</b> are subject to forwarding, processing, or consumption. On the contrary, <b>Data Apps</b> comprehends 
			the applications installed onto Connectors to communicate or process data on behalf of participants of the CDS. According to what concern 
			End-Services definition provided in [AD-4], "the access to these services is protected and the relative usage is managed by the policy framework. 
			These services shall allow consumers to access data, applications and computing and storage resources”. Considering End-Services as Data Apps, 
			they rely on Connectors. The Data App concept is largely determined by functionality and highlights a formal description of the function,
			deployment prerequisites. Data Apps are self-contained and self-descriptive software packages extending the functionality of the generic Connector 
			with custom capabilities. In addition, there are <b>Data App Plug-ins</b> and <b>Data App Assets</b>. A Data App Plug-in is an add-on of a Data App, 
			adding new capabilities to it. The extension management process for selection, installation, and maintenance of such plugins has to be implemented by 
			the respective Data App in accordance with the security policies of the Connector. A Data App Asset is a machine-interpretable Data Asset, 
			such as a script file, algorithm, rule set, or another type of code, which execution relies on a particular runtime environment.
		<br><br>
			Concerning the resources’ content, <b>named</b> kind of content has a permanent identifier that is unique within a context or collection. 
			There is no identifier (name) for <b>anonymous</b> content. Both kinds of content are disjoint, i.e., 
			there is no single entity that is simultaneously an instance of both concepts.
		<br><br>
			Infrastructure facet is related to description of certified components used by participants in the Copernicus Data Space in order 
			to perform business interactions, leading to the exchange and consumption of resources in compliance with defined regulations. 
			It comprehends all the <b>ecosystem components</b> of the Copernicus Data Space, meant as the Intermediary Services stated in [AD-4] 
			as “all the trusted entities within the ecosystem, competing in providing metadata, creating a business model around services, 
			establishing trust among participants” [AD-4].
		<br><br>
			These services are the pillars of the ecosystem set up and are unique, within the scope of ecosystem intermediary.
		<br><br>
			The <b>Connector</b> is its core building block, a communication server providing and consuming data by means of Data Apps via a number of 
			resource <b>endpoints</b>. It constitutes the basis for the implementation of other, more specialized components. 
			A Participant providing an end-service will be supplied with proper number of Connectors and relevant correct properties to 
			deploy their applications, according to an agreed deployment mode. <b>Data Service</b> is the class relevant to these end-services.
		<br><br>
			Each Connector may expose an arbitrary number of resource endpoints, offerings of digital commodities that are optionally advertised
			by publication at the meta-data registries, the Broker, or App Store (TBW) respectively. Furthermore, the responsible Participant 
			operating the Connector (Service Provider) and the deployment type (on-premises vs. cloud) is referenced.
		<br><br>
			Amon the ecosystem components, Identity Provider, Broker, Clearing House and Service Catalogue feature among the ecosystem 
			components. The <b>Broker</b> component is a meta-data registry of Data Asset offerings, whereas the App Store is a registry 
			of Data App offerings and a secure registry for their distribution (TBD). The <b>Identity Provider</b> manages and validates the 
			digital identity of Industrial Data Space Participants. The <b>Clearing House</b> provides clearing and settlement services B2B 
			interactions within the Industrial Data Space. The <b>Service Catalogue</b> catalogues all applications, services, data and software 
			available for re-use by Third-Party users. The <b>Wallet</b> is in charge of managing and allowing financial transaction.
		<br><br>
			A <b>Participant</b> is a legal or natural person assuming a role (or more than one role) in the CDS. For certain, critical roles to assume,
			participants must undergo a certification. <b>Certification</b> of participants is considered a measure to establish trust across the 
			Copernicus Data Space. A Participant can be an organization (or organizational unit) or an individual. If the participant is an
			individual, he or she may assume a specific role in the corresponding organization.
		<br><br>
			The participant concept may indicate the type of business and the domain in which operates.
		<br><br>
			Each Participant can be assigned to one or more unambiguously defined Sites. Site information comprises the name and address of 
			the site as well as geo-location information. It is particularly important in cases in which specific rules (e.g., national law)
			apply, affecting, for example, the data usage control policy.
		<br><br>
			Each Action that a Participant can perform thanks to a Data Service could have an associated price (relevant to the involved Resource). 
		<br><br>
			Information relevant to an Action, the Data Service that allows it and the Participant who performs it are stored as transaction 
			data into the Clearing House. The Wallet Service reads the transaction information and calculate the cost consumed by the 
			Participant on the basis of the action and its pricing strategy.
		<br><br>
			Then, the Wallet Service records the transaction and associates it to the specific participant’s wallet.
		<br><br>	
			The <b>Rules</b> specify <b>Actions</b> that an involved Participant is obliged, permitted or prohibited to perform with respect to Resource.
			Formal <b>Constraints</b> state the applicability of Rules and refine the interpretation of Actions. 
			An example of constraint is that all Participants with their headquarter in Europe might be a potential 
			consumer of GDPR-releated data.
		<br><br>
			An Action is associated with the Resource via the action property in a Rule.
		<br><br>
			The Rule provides the specific interpretations of the Action. For example; an Action is permitted to be exercised on the 
			target Resource when related to a Permission. When related to a Prohibition, the Action indicates the operation that is 
			prohibited to be exercised on the target Resource. When related to a Duty, the Action indicates the agreed operation that 
			is obligatory to be fulfilled by a Participant.
		<br><br>
			Constraints are boolean/logical expressions that can be used to refine the semantics of an Action and Participant/Resource 
			or declare the conditions applicable to a Rule. Constraints can be represented as a Constraint class or Logical Constraint class.
			A Logical Constraint will refer to existing Constraints as its operands. 
		<br><br>
			A Constraint class is used for expressions which compare two operands (which are not Constraints) by one relational operator. 
			If the comparison returns a match the Constraint is satisfied, otherwise it is not satisfied. 
			The Constraint class formulates a comparison expression. For example: the number of usages (the leftOperand) must be smaller 
			than (the operator) the number 10 (the rightOperand). 
		<br><br>
			A <b>Contract</b> express Permissions, Prohibitions and Duties related to the usage of Resource. 
			It defines a validity Period and formal Rules agreed upon by Participants involved in the provision, 
			or subsequent usage of the Resource. Contracts formalize the expectations on behavior of involved Participants i
			n a declarative, technology-agnostic way. The perpetual control and enforcement of such specification 
			level policies may involve the inception of governance processes or, when appropriate the deployment of a technological solution.  
		<br><br>
			The <b>Regulation</b> facet includes also concepts underlying business interactions among the CDS Participant, i.e. 
			the interchange and consumption of Resources according to defined Regulations - supporting security, 
			traceability and usage control purposes. 
		<br><br>		
			Relationships between Facets identified for a Service are: 
			<ul>
				<li>Participant contributes Data App</li>
				<li>Data App is contributed by Participant</li>
				<br><br>
				<li>Participant follows Regulation</li>
				<li>Regulation is followed by Participant</li>
				<br><br>				
				<li>Participant produces Data Assets</li>
				<li>Data Assets is produced by Participant</li>
				<br><br>	
				<li>Data Assets is produced by Participant</li>
				<li>Ecosystem component is provided by Participant</li>
				<br><br>	
				<li>Application (Data App) processes Data Assets</li>
				<li>Data Assets is processed by Data App</li>
				<br><br>	
				<li>Data App uses Ecosystem Component</li>
				<li>Ecosystem Component is used by Data App</li>
			</ul>

			In Table 1 we drafted a mapping among the identified Facets representing a Service/ Eco-System, 
			and the Classes constituting each of them.
